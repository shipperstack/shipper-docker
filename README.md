# shipper-docker

Repository housing files to create/build/run Docker images of the shipper platform

**Warning: currently not finished.** We are in the process of migrating organizations and repositories and as a result the placeholder commands below will NOT work until we get accepted by Docker's open source initiative. You will need to manually build and run the images for the time being.


## Installation (does not work yet!)

Run:

```
docker-compose up -d --no-build
```


## Build

Run:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

## Migrating

WIP

## Documentation
